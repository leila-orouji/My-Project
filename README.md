# CNN Image Classification 

## Overview
Using CNN to classify a group of images to 3 classes.\n
Data set consists of 300 images for all groups.

## Goals
The aim of this project is to create a model in which gets images from user and classifys the given image to one of the 3 classes.
We are going to create API for the model based on FastAPI then create a Docker image and Implement CI/CD pipeline.

## Datasets
Dataset includes 100 images for each classes. So, totally we have 300 images.

## Tools
Python, Tensorflow, Keras, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD
